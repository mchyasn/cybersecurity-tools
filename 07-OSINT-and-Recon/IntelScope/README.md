# IntelScope

## Description

**IntelScope** is a company and employee reconnaissance tool designed to extract names, emails, and user identifiers from public sources like LinkedIn and Crunchbase. It enriches the data using email pattern formats and outputs a CSV file ready for use in phishing campaigns, password spraying, or red team infrastructure setups. This simulates real-world APT-style recon workflows.

## Features

* Scrapes names from Bing-indexed LinkedIn profiles
* Simulated Crunchbase executive scraping
* Email enrichment with configurable formatting
* Outputs clean CSV for phishing/spray ops
* Easy to extend and plug into recon pipelines
