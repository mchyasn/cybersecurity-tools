# IoTExploitHunter

**IoTExploitHunter** is a reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery tool designed to scan embedded IoT protocols including **UPnP**, **MQTT**, and **Telnet**. It identifies misconfigurations, exposed services, and security weaknesses in commonly overlooked device stacks.

> Created for red teamers, embedded security testers, and IoT researchers.

---

## Protocols Supported

* **UPnP (SSDP)**: Detects devices broadcasting discovery messages
* **MQTT**: Checks for open, unauthenticated MQTT brokers
* **Telnet**: Attempts basic connection to grab banner (if open)

---

## Features

* Scans individual protocols via command-line
* Passive UPnP discovery via Scapy
* MQTT client probe using paho-mqtt
* Telnet port check and banner grab
* Designed for stealth and safe recon — no exploits used

---

## Installation

```bash
cd IoTExploitHunter
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# General syntax
python3 main.py <protocol> <target> [--port <port>]
```

### Protocol Options

* `upnp`: Broadcasts M-SEARCH SSDP query (target ignored)
* `mqtt`: Connects to MQTT broker (default port 1883)
* `telnet`: Connects to Telnet port (default 23)

### Examples

```bash
sudo python3 main.py upnp 0.0.0.0
python3 main.py mqtt 192.168.1.100
python3 main.py telnet 192.168.1.101
```
