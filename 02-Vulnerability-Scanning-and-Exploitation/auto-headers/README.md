# auto-headers — HTTP Security Headers Scanner

### auto-headers is a lightweight Python tool that scans websites for missing or misconfigured HTTP security headers. It helps identify web applications that lack essential protections like Content Security Policy, HSTS, and other important defenses.

What It Does
------------
- Sends an HTTP GET request to a specified URL.
- Checks for the presence of critical HTTP security headers.
- Highlights missing headers.
- Saves results to timestamped log files in the logs/ directory.

Headers Checked
---------------
- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy
```
