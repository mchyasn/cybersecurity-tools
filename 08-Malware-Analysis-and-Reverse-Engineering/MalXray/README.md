# MalXray



## Description

**MalXray** is a lightweight dynamic malware analysis sandbox that simulates execution of unknown binaries in a controlled environment. It monitors file, process, and registry activity using a simulated logger, then generates both JSON and HTML timeline reports for analysis. Designed for SOC teams, analysts, and research labs needing fast behavioral triage.

## Features

* Simulates dynamic execution of a sample
* Tracks behavioral events (file/process/registry/network)
* Logs timeline to both `.json` and `.html`
* Simple YAML configuration for monitoring scope
* Lightweight alternative to full sandboxes like Cuckoo

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
cd MalXray
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 main.py -s samples/test_sample.bat
```

Example output:

```
[+] Starting behavior monitor...
[+] Executing sample: samples/test_sample.bat
[+] Generating timeline report...
```

## Configuration

`configs/config.yaml`:

```yaml
monitor:
  log_path: "logs/activity.log"
  duration: 10

report:
  json_output: "reports/timeline.json"
  html_output: "reports/timeline.html"
```

* `duration`: seconds to simulate behavior collection
* `log_path`: event simulation log
* `report`: output paths for final timeline artifacts
