# YARASmith

**YARASmith** is a modular YARA rule builder and tester for malware analysts and threat hunters. It assists in creating high-quality rules using keyword and hex pattern inputs, testing them against sample sets, and packaging them into rule packs for reuse or sharing.

## Features

* Interactive YARA rule generation
* Supports ASCII keyword and hex byte pattern input
* Embeds metadata (author, family, etc.) into rules
* Tests rules against sample directories
* Outputs match results per file
* Exports combined rule packs
