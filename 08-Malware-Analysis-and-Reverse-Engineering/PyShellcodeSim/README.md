# PyShellcodeSim


## Description

**PyShellcodeSim** is a lightweight shellcode emulator and disassembler built using Unicorn and Capstone engines. It supports both x86 and x64 shellcode, emulates execution instruction-by-instruction, and helps researchers analyze suspicious behaviors like syscalls, encodings, and decoders.

Ideal for use in malware analysis workflows, educational reverse engineering, and demonstration of shellcode behavior in a safe, isolated environment.

## Features

* Disassembles raw shellcode using Capstone
* Emulates execution with Unicorn Engine
* Supports both x86 and x64
* Detects invalid memory operations and RET crashes
* Optional dual mode: disasm, emu, or both
