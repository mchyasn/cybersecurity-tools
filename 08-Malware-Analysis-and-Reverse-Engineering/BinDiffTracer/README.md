# BinDiffTracer


## Description

**BinDiffTracer** is a binary diffing and patch analysis tool designed to identify and visualize changes between two binary versions (e.g., malicious vs. patched). It disassembles the binaries using Capstone, compares instruction streams, and highlights opcode differences for vulnerability analysis and reverse engineering.

## Features

* Compare old vs. new binary versions
* Detect added, removed, or modified instructions
* Output differences in JSON and HTML report format
* Uses Capstone for lightweight disassembly
* Highlights suspicious opcode deltas

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
cd BinDiffTracer
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Create minimal test binaries (simulated)
echo -ne '\xB8\x01\x00\x00\x00\xC3' > binaries/old.bin
```

```bash
echo -ne '\xB8\x02\x00\x00\x00\xC3' > binaries/new.bin
```

```bash
# Run diff analysis
python3 main.py -o binaries/old.bin -n binaries/new.bin
```

## Configuration

`configs/config.yaml`

```yaml
report:
  json_output: "reports/diff.json"
  html_output: "reports/diff.html"
```

* `json_output`: path to JSON result
* `html_output`: path to HTML visualization
