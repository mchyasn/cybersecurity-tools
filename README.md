# cybersecurity-tools

## Description

The cybersecurity-tools repository is a comprehensive, production-grade arsenal of over 70 purpose-built cybersecurity tools, designed to simulate real-world offensive, defensive, forensic, and AI/ML-based security operations. Each tool is structured under one of 10 strategic categories that align with modern cyber warfare, SOC workflows, red/blue team exercises, and malware reverse engineering pipelines.

This project goes beyond toy scripts: every tool here is built for real operational use, tested in isolated environments, and compliant with strict development rules including:

Modular architecture (no monolithic scripts)

- Fully documented and GitHub-optimized README.md files (with screenshots, usage, license, and install steps)
- Verified execution and CLI compliance (argparse, error handling, file validation)
- Professional folder layout with /src, /configs, /docs, /screenshots, /data
- Real screenshots for every tool, named and version-controlled (e.g., 0.png, 1.png)
- AI/ML-driven detection models (for phishing, malware, adversarial inputs, log anomalies)

## Purpose & Portfolio Value

### This repository showcases:

- A mature understanding of full-spectrum cybersecurity workflows
- Ability to design, implement, and document production-ready tools
- A deep grasp of both classical security operations and modern ML-based detection paradigms
- It is engineered for security professionals, red/blue teamers, malware analysts, and anyone building a serious cybersecurity portfolio.
